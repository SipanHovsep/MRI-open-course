Welcome to MR Bazaar!
=====================

*MR Bazaar* is a Middle-Eastern-bazaar–style gateway to MRI: a place to browse
models, tutorials, hardware notes, code, and curated external resources. Like a
traditional bazaar—where you can find almost anything—you’ll find concise
explanations, practical guides, and links to the best open resources.
