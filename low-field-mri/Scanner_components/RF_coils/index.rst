RF Coils
========

With a stable magnet in place, attention shifts to the RF hardware â€” essential for both transmitting and receiving signals.

The process starts with hand-winding copper wire into a solenoid coil. This simple but precise step defines the sensitivity of the system.

Next, the **transmit/receive (TR) switch** is built to alternate between exciting the spins and detecting the returning signal.

Shielding is added to protect the switch from external noise and unwanted coupling.

The electronics chain is then expanded with **filters, amplifiers, and a regulated power supply**, ensuring clean operation.

Once complete, the RF assembly is installed into the scanner.
